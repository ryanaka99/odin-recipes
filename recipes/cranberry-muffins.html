    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Leftover cranberry sauce is obviously great on turkey sandwiches, and it's
      even delicious warmed up and spooned over ice cream or pancakes, but have
      you tried it in muffins? This easy recipe for cranberry muffins uses a cup
      of your smooth or chunky leftover cranberry sauce. The batter comes
      together in minutes and the moist, sweet muffins are perfect for a
      post-Thanksgiving breakfast or snack.
