    <p>
      The best potatoes for mashing depends on your personal preference, as some
      varieties will give you fluffy results while others will give you creamy
      results. This recipe calls for baking potatoes (a.k.a. russets), which are
      ideal for light and fluffy mashed potatoes. A good all-purpose potato,
      such as Yukon Gold, is also always a crowd-pleaser.
