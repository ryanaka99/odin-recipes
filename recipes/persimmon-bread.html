      <p class="text">
        As far as fall baking goes, there are other flavors that hog the
        limelight (we're looking at you, pumpkin spice!). The humble persimmon
        is oft forgotten, except by those who already love its honey-like flavor
        and know that it is only available to enjoy during a short season.

      <p class="text bigger-mb">
        Persimmon bread is the perfect easy recipe to make with a surplus of
        persimmon pulp. Using extra ripe hachiya persimmons, the sweet flesh is
        easy to scoop away from the persimmon skin with a spoon. For 1 cup of
        persimmon pulp, you'll need 2 to 3 hachiya persimmons, depending on
        their size. You can also use smaller fuyu persimmons, which typically
        take longer to fully ripen than hachiya.
